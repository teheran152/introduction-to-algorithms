# Matrix Operations

numerical stability : due to the limited precision of floating-point representations in actual computers, round-off errors in numerical computations may become amplified over the course of a computation, leading to incorrect results

## 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations


## 28.2 Inverting matrices

## 28.3 Symmetric positive-definite matrices and least-sqaures approximation
